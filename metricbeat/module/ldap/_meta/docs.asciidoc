This module collects data from LDAP servers.

To collect metrics, {beatnane_uc} communicates with any LDAP enabled directory service.

Its main purpose is to collect metrics from the virtual subtree "cn=Monitor"
which is provided by servers like:

* Open LDAP
* RedHat / Fedora / 389 Directory Server
* Sun / Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition
* Novell / NetIQ eDirectory Server
* IBM Tivoli Directory Server
* OpenDj / OpenDS / Oracle Unified Directory

=== Compatibility

The LDAP module is tested with openLDAP and NetIQ eDirectory but should work with any LDAP enabled server (excluding the mentioned cn=Monitor feature)
